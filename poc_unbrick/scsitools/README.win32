This tool can be compiled under Windows with MinGW and the Windows port of sg3_util.
Everything runs unmodified with MSYS except perhaps for
- the library in which case you might have to change the LDFLAGS in Makefile to:
LDFLAGS=/usr/local/lib/libsgutils2.a
- the include directory in which case you might have to change the DEFINES in Makefile to:
DEFINES=-I/usr/local/include
