This file document the format of the command file used by the elftosb tool.
By no way our tools tries to be compatible with Freescale's elftosb2.
However, our format is more subset of the general one.

The parse supports a limited form of comments: comments starting with // and ending at the end of the line.

A file first contains the list of sources:

sources
{
    hw_init = "sdram_init.elf";
    rockbox = "rockbox.elf";
}

It can then contain an arbitrary number of section. A section is identified by a number.
Within a section, three commands are supported: "load", "jump" and "call":

section(0x626f6f74) // hex for 'boot'
{
    load hw_init;
    call hw_init;
    load rockbox;
    jump rockbox;
}

Finally, both elftosb and sbtoelf tools use key files. A key file is a list of keys.
Each key consist is 128-bit long and is written in hexadecimal:

00000000000000000000000000000000

The parser does not handle blank line and only allows a final newline at the end of the file.
A file is allowed to contain zero (0) keys.
